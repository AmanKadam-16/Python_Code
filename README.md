# The Ultimate Python Course: Chapters 4-13

This document contains the code, explanations, and problem sets for chapters 4 through 13.

## Chapter 4: Lists and Tuples

### `01_list.py`

```python
# In python List is a datatype used to store a collection of items.
# List is similar to Arrays and is enclosed within square brackets [].
# Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.

# Creating a list
my_list = [2, "cat", True, 45.6] # A list can store multiple datatypes
print(f"Original list: {my_list}")

# --- List Indexing and Slicing ---
# List elements can be accessed with indexes (starting from 0)
item_list = ["city", 34, False, "Stacy"]
print(f"Element at index 1: {item_list[1]}")

# Slicing works just like with strings
print(f"Slice from index 1 to end: {item_list[1:]}")

# Modifying a list element
item_list[0] = "town"
print(f"Modified list: {item_list}")
```

### `02_list_methods.py`

```python
# Python provides many built-in methods for lists.
# Since lists are mutable, most of these methods modify the list in-place.

demo_list = [3, 2, 43, 23, 54, 12, 5, 32, 65]
print(f"Original Demo List: {demo_list}")

# 1. sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.
demo_list.sort()
print(f"Sorted list (asc): {demo_list}")

# To sort in descending order, use the reverse=True argument.
demo_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(f"Sorted list (desc): {demo_list}")

# 2. reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the list.
demo_list.reverse()
print(f"Reversed list: {demo_list}")

# 3. append(): Adds a new element to the end of the list.
demo_list.append(100)
print(f"List after appending 100: {demo_list}")

# 4. insert(index, element): Inserts an element at a specified index.
demo_list.insert(2, 99) # Insert 99 at index 2
print(f"List after inserting 99 at index 2: {demo_list}")

# 5. pop(index): Removes and returns the element at the specified index. If no index is given, it removes the last element.
popped_element = demo_list.pop(3)
print(f"Popped element at index 3: {popped_element}")
print(f"List after pop: {demo_list}")

# 6. remove(element): Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
demo_list.remove(54)
print(f"List after removing 54: {demo_list}")
```

### `03_tuple.py`

```python
# A tuple is another standard sequence data type in Python.
# Tuples are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after creation.
# They are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses ().

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)
print(f"My tuple: {my_tuple}")
print(f"Type of my_tuple: {type(my_tuple)}")

# A tuple with a single element needs a trailing comma
single_item_tuple = (1,)
print(f"Single item tuple: {single_item_tuple}")

# Attempting to change a tuple will result in a TypeError
# my_tuple[1] = "world"  # This line would raise a TypeError
```

### `04_tuple_methods.py`

```python
# Tuples have fewer methods than lists because they are immutable.

my_tuple = (1, 7, 2, 5, 7, 8, 7)
print(f"Our example tuple: {my_tuple}")

# 1. count(element): Returns the number of times an element appears.
count_of_7 = my_tuple.count(7)
print(f"The number 7 appears {count_of_7} times.")

# 2. index(element): Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element.
index_of_5 = my_tuple.index(5)
print(f"The first occurrence of 5 is at index {index_of_5}.")
```

### `gist.md`

```markdown
# Chapter 4 Summary
## Lists
- Mutable (changeable) sequence of items.
- Defined with square brackets `[]`.
- Rich set of methods like `append()`, `sort()`, `pop()`.

## Tuples
- Immutable (unchangeable) sequence of items.
- Defined with parentheses `()`.
- Faster and more memory-efficient than lists.
- Used for data that should not change.
```

### Chapter 4 - Problem Set

#### 1. Store seven fruits in a list entered by the user.

```python
def collect_fruits() -> None:
    fruits: list = []
    print('Please enter seven fruit names:')
    for i in range(7):
        fruit_name = input(f'Enter fruit {i + 1}: ')
        fruits.append(fruit_name)
    print(f'\nHere is your list of fruits: {fruits}')

collect_fruits()
```

#### 2. Accept marks of 6 students and display them in a sorted manner.

```python
def sort_marks() -> None:
    marks: list = []
    for i in range(6):
        student_mark = int(input(f'Enter marks for student {i + 1}: '))
        marks.append(student_mark)
    
    marks.sort()
    print(f'\nThe marks in sorted order are: {marks}')

sort_marks()
```

#### 3. Check that a tuple cannot be changed.

```python
def demonstrate_immutability() -> None:
    my_tuple = (10, 20, 'thirty', 40)
    print(f'Original tuple: {my_tuple}')
    try:
        print('Attempting to change the element at index 2...')
        my_tuple[2] = 'new value'
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f'Error: {e}')
        print('Conclusion: Tuples are immutable.')

demonstrate_immutability()
```

#### 4. Sum a list with 4 numbers.

```python
def sum_list() -> None:
    numbers: list = [15, 25, 10, 50]
    total = sum(numbers)
    print(f'The list is: {numbers}')
    print(f'The sum is: {total}')

sum_list()
```

#### 5. Count the number of zeros in a tuple.

```python
def count_zeros() -> None:
    a: tuple = (7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9)
    num_zeros = a.count(0)
    print(f'The tuple is: {a}')
    print(f'Number of zeros: {num_zeros}')

count_zeros()
```

## Chapter 5: Dictionaries & Sets

### `01_dictionary.py`

```python
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicate keys.

# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {
    "name": "Jason",
    "age": 23,
    "is_native": False
}
print(my_dict)

# Accessing items
print(f"Name: {my_dict['name']}")

# Changing values
my_dict["age"] = 24
print(f"Updated dictionary: {my_dict}")
```

### `02_dictionary_methods.py`

```python
# Dictionary methods provide ways to interact with dictionary data.
marks = {
    "Harry": 95,
    "Shubham": 88,
    "Rohan": 76
}

# 1. keys(): Returns a view object displaying a list of all the keys.
print(f"Keys: {marks.keys()}")

# 2. values(): Returns a view object displaying a list of all values.
print(f"Values: {marks.values()}")

# 3. items(): Returns a view object displaying a list of key-value tuple pairs.
print(f"Items: {marks.items()}")

# 4. update({key:value}): Updates the dictionary with specified key-value pairs.
marks.update({"Rohan": 80, "Aman": 99})
print(f"Updated marks: {marks}")

# 5. get(key): Returns the value of the specified key. Returns None if key not found.
print(f"Marks for Harry: {marks.get('Harry')}")
print(f"Marks for nonexistent key: {marks.get('Jason')}") # Safe way to access keys
```

### `03_sets.py`

```python
# A set is a collection which is both unordered and un-indexed.
# Sets are written with curly brackets {} and do not allow duplicate values.

# Creating a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4} # Note: the duplicate '2' will be ignored
print(f"My set: {my_set}")

# An empty set is created using the set() constructor
empty_set = set()
print(f"Empty set: {empty_set}")
```

### `04_set_methods.py`

```python
# Sets have several methods to perform operations.
my_set = {1, 5, "Harry", 32}
print(f"Original set: {my_set}")

# 1. add(element): Adds an element to the set.
my_set.add(45)
print(f"Set after adding 45: {my_set}")

# 2. remove(element): Removes the specified element. Raises a KeyError if not found.
my_set.remove(5)
print(f"Set after removing 5: {my_set}")

# 3. union() and intersection()
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
print(f"Union: {set1.union(set2)}")
print(f"Intersection: {set1.intersection(set2)}")
```

### `gist.md`

```markdown
# Chapter 5 Summary
## Dictionaries
- Key-value pairs, defined with `{}`.
- Ordered, mutable, and no duplicate keys.
- Methods: `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `update()`, `get()`.

## Sets

```

### Chapter 5 - Problem Set

#### 1. Create a Hindi-to-English translation dictionary.

```python
def dictionary_lookup() -> None:
    translation_dict = {
        "pankha": "fan",
        "dabba": "box",
        "vastu": "item"
    }
    word = input("Enter a Hindi word to translate: ").lower()
    print(f"The translation is: {translation_dict.get(word, 'Word not found!')}")

dictionary_lookup()
```

#### 2. Display unique numbers from user input.

```python
def display_unique_numbers() -> None:
    unique_numbers = set()
    for i in range(8):
        num = int(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
        unique_numbers.add(num)
    print(f"The unique numbers are: {unique_numbers}")

display_unique_numbers()
```

#### 3. Can a set have `18` (int) and `"18"` (str)?

```python
s = {18, "18"}
print(s)
print("Yes, a set can contain both 18 and '18' as they are of different data types and thus are unique.")
```

#### 4. What is the length of a set after adding `20`, `20.0`, and `'20'`?

```python
s = set()
s.add(20)
s.add(20.0)
s.add('20')
print(f"The set is: {s}")
print(f"The length of the set is: {len(s)}")
print("Explanation: In Python, 20 and 20.0 are treated as equal in sets, so only one is stored.")
```

#### 5. What is the type of `s = {}`?

```python
s = {}
print(f"The type of s = {{}} is: {type(s)}")
print("It's a dictionary. To create an empty set, you must use set().")
```

#### 6. Create a dictionary of friends and their favorite languages.

```python
def favorite_languages() -> None:
    fav_lang = {}
    for i in range(4):
        name = input(f"Enter friend's name {i+1}: ")
        language = input(f"Enter {name}'s favorite language: ")
        fav_lang[name] = language
    print(f"\nFavorite Languages Dictionary: {fav_lang}")

else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")
```

### `02_if_elif_else.py`

```python
# The if-elif-else ladder is used to check multiple conditions.
# `elif` is short for "else if".

elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

### `03_logical_relational_ops.py`

```python
# Logical and relational operators are used to create complex conditions.
# Relational operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
# Logical operators: and, or, not

age = 25
has_license = True

if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You are allowed to drive.")
else:
    print("You are not allowed to drive.")
```

### `gist.md`

```markdown
# Chapter 6 Summary
## Conditional Statements
- `if`: Executes code if a condition is true.
- `else`: Executes code if the `if` condition is false.
- `elif`: Checks another condition if the previous `if`/`elif` was false.

# The 'while' loop executes as long as a condition is true.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(f"Iteration number: {i}")
    i = i + 1 # Increment i to avoid an infinite loop

print("Loop finished.")
```

### `02_for_loop.py`

```python
# The 'for' loop is used for iterating over a sequence.
# The range() function is often used to generate a sequence of numbers.

# Looping from 0 up to (but not including) 5
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Number: {i}")

# Looping from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Counting: {i}")
```

### `04_loop_control.py`

```python
# Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence.

# 1. break: Terminates the loop entirely.
print("--- Break Example ---")
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# 2. continue: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only.
print("--- Continue Example ---")
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0: # Skip even numbers
        continue
    print(i)
```

### `gist.md`

```markdown
# Chapter 7 Summary
## Loops
- `while` loop: Repeats as long as a condition is true.
- `for` loop: Iterates over a sequence.

## Loop Control
- `break`: Exits the loop immediately.
- `continue`: Skips to the next iteration.
- `pass`: Does nothing; acts as a placeholder.
- `else` block: Runs if the loop completes without a `break`.
```

# Defining a function
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to functions!")

# Calling the function
greet()
```

### `04_recursion.py`

```python
# Recursion is when a function calls itself.
# It must have a 'base case' to stop the recursion.

# Example: Factorial
# factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)

def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive step
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

result = factorial(5)
print(f"The factorial of 5 is {result}.")
```

### `gist.md`

```markdown
# Chapter 8 Summary
## Functions

# Creating a dummy file to read
with open("sample.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write('This is the first line.\n')
    f.write('This is the second line.\n')

# Reading a file ('r' mode is for reading)
f = open("sample.txt", "r")

# 1. read(): Reads the entire file content.
content = f.read()
print(content)

f.close() # Always close the file when done.
```

### `04_with_statement.py`

```python
# The 'with' statement is the preferred way to work with files.
# It automatically closes the file, even if errors occur.

# Reading with 'with'
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(f"Content read using with: \n{content}")

# No need to call f.close()
```

### `gist.md`

```markdown
# Chapter 9 Summary
## File I/O
- Reading and writing data to files on disk.

## File Modes
- `r`: Read (default).
- `w`: Write (overwrites existing file).
- `a`: Append (adds to the end of the file).

## Best Practice
- Use the `with` statement for automatic file closing and error handling.
